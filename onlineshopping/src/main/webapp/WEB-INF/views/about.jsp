		<h1>About US</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p class="lead">We are all very different. We were born in different cities, at different times, we love different music, food, movies. 
		But we have something that unites us all. It is our university project. </p>
		
		<p class="lead"> Our very client Bright Implex Internation has their own web site that they use to display their products while they lack
		an online portal through which they can actually sell the products. As our university project we have decided to biuld this dummy online
		shopping web site just to show them our potential. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead"> Regardless being university students, there wasn't any limitations for us to use industry latest tools and technologies.
		We have used <strong>Java Spring</strong> framework to make our project base. It is a REST based application where all the security parts
		are looked by Spring Security and for the application deployment we have chosen <strong>Amazon Web Services(AWS)</strong> as our hosting
		partner. </p>
